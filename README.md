# 🕯️ myVault

> “a mind in fragments, gathered and stored.”

this is my personal **Obsidian vault** —  
a place where thoughts crystallize into markdown,  
where chaos slowly arranges itself into knowledge.

---

## 🗂️ what’s inside
- notes from study and curiosity  
- drafts, fragments, reflections  
- structured chaos, archived in `.md`  

---

## ⚙️ purpose
I use this repository to **sync my Obsidian notes** across devices using Git.  
nothing fancy — just a way to keep the wandering mind consistent.
