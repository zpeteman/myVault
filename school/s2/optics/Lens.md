## 📐 Equations & Concepts
#### Lens Definitions & Types
- **Lens:** Association of two diopters, at least one spherical, characterized by centers, summits, and refractive index \( n \).
- **Types:**
  - **Thin lenses:** Edge thinner than center; usually convergent (biconvex, plan-convex, meniscus convergent).
  - **Thick lenses:** Edge thicker than center; usually divergent (biconcave, plan-concave, meniscus divergent).

#### Focal Points & Focal Distances
- **Object Focal Point \( F \):** Point on axis whose image is at infinity.
- **Image Focal Point \( F' \):** Point on axis where object at infinity forms an image.
- **Focal Distances:**
  - \( f = OF \) (object), \( f' = OF' \) (image), with \( f = -f' \) (symmetry about lens center).
  - For convergent lens: \( f' > 0 \) (real focus).
  - For divergent lens: \( f' < 0 \) (virtual focus).

#### Optical Center & Thin Lens Approximation
- **Optical Center \( O \):** Point on axis such that any ray passing through \( O \) is undeviated.
- **Thin Lens:** Thickness \( e \) negligible compared to radii \( R_1, R_2 \); \( e \ll |R_1 - R_2| \), \( e \ll |R_1| \), \( e \ll |R_2| \).
- **Symbol:** Segment with ends indicating convergent/divergent nature.
- **Ray Properties:**
  - Ray through \( O \) is undeviated.
  - Gauss conditions: small angles, paraxial rays.
  - Lens index \( n > 1 \).

#### Thin Lens Conjugation & Magnification
- **Conjugation Formula (Thin Lens):**
  - Derived from spherical diopter formulas for both surfaces.
  - For object at \( A \), image at \( A' \):
    $$
    \frac{1}{OA'} - \frac{1}{OA} = \frac{1}{f'}
    $$
  - **Magnification:**
    $$
    \gamma = \frac{A'B'}{AB} = \frac{OA'}{OA}
    $$
- **Vergence:**
  $$
  V = \frac{1}{f'}
  $$
- **Association of Thin Lenses:**
  - For two thin lenses (not in contact):
    $$
    V = V_1 + V_2 - e V_1 V_2
    $$
  - \( V > 0 \): convergent; \( V < 0 \): divergent; \( V = 0 \): afocal.

#### Ray Construction & Applications
- **Principal Rays:**
  - Ray parallel to axis passes through image focus \( F' \).
  - Ray through object focus \( F \) emerges parallel to axis.
  - Ray through optical center \( O \) is undeviated.
- **Image Construction:**
  - Use similar triangles and Thales' theorem for magnification.

#### Vision Defects & Correction
- **Hypermetropia (Farsightedness):**
  - Eye does not converge enough; image forms behind retina.
  - Correction: convergent lenses.
- **Myopia (Nearsightedness):**
  - Eye converges too much; image forms before retina.
  - Correction: divergent lenses.

#### Doublet (Lens System) & Properties
- **Doublet:** System of two thin lenses (not in contact).
  - **Vergence:** \( V = V_1 + V_2 - e V_1 V_2 \)
  - **Magnification:** Product of individual lens magnifications.
  - **Focal Points & Nature:** Real if \( V > 0 \), virtual if \( V < 0 \).

## 📝 Notes
- Thin lens formulas relate object and image positions, focal lengths, and magnification.
- Principal rays allow geometric construction of images.
- Vision defects are corrected by appropriate lens types (convergent/divergent).
- Doublets combine properties of two lenses; total vergence and magnification depend on both lenses and their separation.
- Always use sign conventions for distances and focal lengths.
